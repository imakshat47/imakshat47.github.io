### About Me

Aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in data structures, algorithm design, and object-oriented programming. Eager to contribute to high-quality software development and adept at quickly learning new technologies and thriving in fast-paced, innovative environments.

As a Data Engineer and Analyst with over three years of experience at Accenture, I specialize in developing scalable data pipelines, implementing machine learning models, and ensuring robust data governance. My technical expertise is rooted in Python, C++, SQL, and big data technologies like Apache Spark and Hadoop. I have hands-on experience across multiple cloud platforms, holding certifications from Google Cloud (Professional Cloud Architect & ML Engineer), AWS (Cloud Practitioner), and Azure.

Currently pursuing a Master of Technology in Computer Science (Analytics) at the National Institute of Technology, Delhi, I am deepening my expertise in AI and advanced algorithms. I am actively seeking challenging opportunities to leverage my skills in data engineering, machine learning, and software development to create innovative and sustainable solutions.
